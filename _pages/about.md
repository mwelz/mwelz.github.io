Welcome to my website! I am a second-year PhD candidate in statistics at the [Econometric Institute](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics){:target="_blank"} at the Erasmus University Rotterdam, where I am blessed to be supervised by [Patrick Groenen](https://www.eur.nl/people/patrick-groenen){:target="_blank"} and [Andreas Alfons](https://personal.eur.nl/alfons/){:target="_blank"}. I am also affiliated with the [Department of Public Health](https://www.publichealthrotterdam.com/){:target="_blank"} at Erasmus Medical Center. __This website is under construction, so there might be broken links and placeholder elements!__

My research iterests are:

* Robust estimation and inference in noncontinuous data;
* Mathematical statistics, in particular empirical processes and high-dimensional statistics;
* Applied statistics and field-specific problem solving, in particular in medicine, psychology, and economics.

A detailed description is provided on my [research page](). To ensure that my research is easily reproducible and practically applicable, I design open-source and user-friendly software of the models I invent and work with. You can find an overview of my packages on my [software page]() and on my [GitHub account]().
