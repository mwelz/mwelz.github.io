Welcome to my website! I am a postdoc in statistics at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html){:target="_blank"} in the group of [Carolin Strobl](https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en/areas/meth/methoden/team/carolinstrobl.html){:target="_blank"}. <span style="font-weight:bold;">In October 2025, I will be visiting the statistics department at London School of Economics, upon invitation by [Irini Moustaki](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/irini-moustaki){:target="_blank"}.</span>

I received my PhD from the [Econometric Institute](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics){:target="_blank"} at Erasmus University Rotterdam in 2025, where I was blessed to be supervised by  [Patrick Groenen](https://www.eur.nl/people/patrick-groenen){:target="_blank"} and [Andreas Alfons](https://personal.eur.nl/alfons/){:target="_blank"}. In fall 2023, I was visiting Massachusetts Institute of Technology upon invitation by [Victor Chernozhukov](https://www.victorchernozhukov.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Mert Demirer](https://www.mertdemirer.com/){:target="_blank"}. I am also affiliated with the [Department of Public Health](https://www.publichealthrotterdam.com/){:target="_blank"} at Erasmus Medical Center (MC).

My research is motivated by practical problems in empirical research in the health and social sciences, for which I develop new statistical methods, derive their theoretical properties, and package them in user-friendly open-source software. 

My current research interests are centered around robustness in the analysis of categorical data, which was the topic of my [PhD thesis](https://pure.eur.nl/en/publications/robust-categorical-data-analysis){:target="_blank"}. For instance, the methods developed by me and my coauthors can be used to identify and account for careless responding in questionnaires. Details can be found on my [research page]({% link _pages/research.md %}){:target="_blank"}.


<!---
In my research, I develop statistical methods for the analysis of datasets in economics, health sciences, and management. My research is motivated by situations in which standard modeling assumptions fail to hold, for instance in discrete and/or noisy data of possibly high dimensionality. I currently work on statistical methods for robust estimation and inference in categorical data. 

My research interests are:

* Robust statistics with non-continuous data;
* Mathematical statistics (Empirical processes and high-dimensional models);
* Statistical computing and computational statistics;
* Applied statistics and field-specific problem solving, in particular in medicine, psychology, and economics.
