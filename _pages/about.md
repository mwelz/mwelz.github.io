I am PhD candidate in econometrics and statistics at the [Econometric Institute](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics){:target="_blank"} at the Erasmus University Rotterdam since 2020, where I am blessed to be supervised by [Patrick Groenen](https://www.eur.nl/people/patrick-groenen){:target="_blank"} and [Andreas Alfons](https://personal.eur.nl/alfons/){:target="_blank"}. I am also affiliated with the [Department of Public Health](https://www.publichealthrotterdam.com/){:target="_blank"} at Erasmus Medical Center (MC). In fall 2023, I was a visiting Massachusetts Institute of Technology upon invitation by [Victor Chernozhukov](https://www.victorchernozhukov.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Mert Demirer](https://www.mertdemirer.com/){:target="_blank"}. In fall 2024, I will join the University of Zurich as a postdoctoral researcher in statistics.


In my research, I develop statistical methods for the analysis of datasets in economics, health sciences, and management. My research is motivated by situations in which standard modeling assumptions fail to hold, for instance in discrete and/or noisy data of possibly high dimensionality. I currently work on statistical methods for robust estimation and inference in categorical data. 

<!---
My research interests are:

* Robust statistics with non-continuous data;
* Mathematical statistics (Empirical processes and high-dimensional models);
* Statistical computing and computational statistics;
* Applied statistics and field-specific problem solving, in particular in medicine, psychology, and economics.
