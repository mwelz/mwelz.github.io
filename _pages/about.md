I am PhD candidate in econometrics and statistics at the [Econometric Institute](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics){:target="_blank"} at the Erasmus University Rotterdam since 2020, where I am blessed to be supervised by [Patrick Groenen](https://www.eur.nl/people/patrick-groenen){:target="_blank"} and [Andreas Alfons](https://personal.eur.nl/alfons/){:target="_blank"}. I am also affiliated with the [Department of Public Health](https://www.publichealthrotterdam.com/){:target="_blank"} at Erasmus Medical Center (MC). 


In my research, I develop statistical methods for the analysis of datasets in economics, health sciences, and management. My research is motivated by situations in which standard modeling assumptions fail to hold, for instance in discrete and/or noisy data of possibly high dimensionality. I currently work on methods for robust estimation and inference in large rating-scale datasets subject to measurement error.

<!---
My research interests are:

* Robust statistics with non-continuous data;
* Mathematical statistics (Empirical processes and high-dimensional models);
* Statistical computing and computational statistics;
* Applied statistics and field-specific problem solving, in particular in medicine, psychology, and economics.
