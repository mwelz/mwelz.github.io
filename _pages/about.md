I am a second-year PhD candidate in statistics at the [Econometric Institute](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics){:target="_blank"} at the Erasmus University Rotterdam, and I am blessed to be supervised by [Patrick Groenen](https://www.eur.nl/people/patrick-groenen){:target="_blank"} and [Andreas Alfons](https://personal.eur.nl/alfons/){:target="_blank"}. I am also affiliated with the [Department of Public Health](https://www.publichealthrotterdam.com/){:target="_blank"} at Erasmus Medical Center (MC).
