Welcome to my website! I am a second-year PhD candidate in statistics at the [Econometric Institute](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics){:target="_blank"} at the Erasmus University Rotterdam, where I am blessed to be supervised by [Patrick Groenen](https://www.eur.nl/people/patrick-groenen){:target="_blank"} and [Andreas Alfons](https://personal.eur.nl/alfons/){:target="_blank"}. I am also affiliated with the [Department of Public Health](https://www.publichealthrotterdam.com/){:target="_blank"} at Erasmus Medical Center.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
