## Thesis Supervision
Since the academic year 2020-21, I have been the main supervisor of five bachelor theses and the second assessor of five bachelor theses and two master theses. All theses were for obtaining the degree of bachelor or master in econometrics at Erasmus University.

## Course Teaching

### 2020/21
* <span class="font-weight-bold">[FEB22015X: Academic Skills (Econometrics)](https://eur.osiris-student.nl/#/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?taal=EN&cursuscode=FEB22015X&collegejaar=2020){:target="_blank"}</span><br>
  <em>Spring 2021, Erasmus University (online), 4 ECTS. Course coordinator: [Evelot Westerink-Duijzer](https://www.eur.nl/en/people/evelot-westerink-duijzer){:target="_blank"}.<br>
  My Role: Teaching Assistant; total workload of 85 hours. </em><br>
  In this course, 2nd year students of the bachelor program in econometrics learn essential research skills such as scientific writing, and presenting. I taught two groups of ~15 students each and graded the (individual) assignments (five in total).<br>

* <span class="font-weight-bold">[FEB23012: Seminar in Econometrics](https://eur.osiris-student.nl/#/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?taal=EN&cursuscode=FEB23012&collegejaar=2020){:target="_blank"}</span><br>
  <em>Spring 2021, Erasmus University (online), 12 ECRS. Course coordinator: [Dick van Dijk](https://sites.google.com/view/dickvandijk/){:target="_blank"}. <br>
   My Role: Group Supervisor; total workload of 96 hours. </em><br>
  A seminar for 3rd and 4th year students of the bachelor program in econometrics. During this seminar, groups of 3 or 4 students will try to answer a complex practical research question using econometric knowledge obtained during earlier courses. They have to report the results of the research in a scientific report and in a presentation. <br>
  Unfortunately, the groups that I supervised did not evaluate this course.

* <span class="font-weight-bold">[FEB21018X: Introduction to Statistics](https://eur.osiris-student.nl/#/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?taal=EN&cursuscode=FEB21018X&collegejaar=2020){:target="_blank"}</span><br>
  <em>Fall 2020, Erasmus University (online), 6 ECTS. Course coordinator: [Christiaan Heij](https://www.eur.nl/people/christiaan-heij){:target="_blank"}. <br>
   My Role: Tech Support; total workload of 40 hours. </em><br>
   This is a typical introductory statistics course for 1st year bachelor students in STEM fields. This course was taught during the Covid-19 pandemic, hence all course activities had to be moved online (we used Zoom, MS Teams, and [ANS](https://ans.app/landing){:target="_blank"}). My job as tech support was to assist with moving the course online (such as online integration of exams) and to help the coordinator and the five TAs with technological issues.
   

### 2019/20
* <span class="font-weight-bold">[FEB2003X: Introduction to Multivariate Statistics](https://eur.osiris-student.nl/#/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?taal=EN&cursuscode=FEB22003X&collegejaar=2019){:target="_blank"}</span><br>
  <em>Fall 2019, Erasmus University, 4 ECTS. Course coordinator: [Mikhail Zhelonkin](https://www.eur.nl/en/people/mikhail-zhelonkin){:target="_blank"}.<br>
  My Role: Teaching Assistant; total workload of 60 hours. </em><br>
  In this course, 2nd year students of the bachelor program in econometrics are introduced to multivariate statistical methods. They learn how familiar statistical concepts such as the mean, variance, and normal distribution generalize to the <em>p</em>-dimensional space and are introduced to multivariate techniques such as PCA. I taught two groups of ~20 students each and graded their assignments (two in total) as well as the final examination (two exercises, ~150 students in total).<br>
