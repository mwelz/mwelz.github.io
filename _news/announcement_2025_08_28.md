Our paper [*A comparative analysis of heterogeneity in lung cancer screening effectiveness in two randomised controlled trials*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63471-6){:target="_blank"} has been published in *Nature Communications*. This paper is particularly special to me because it originated from my MSc thesis all the way back in 2020!
